  <h2 class="ml6 mb3">ABOUT TOXIC TIE</h2>
  <div id="bio-container">
    <p class="ml6 bio">
      We're Sun, Sonia, Bryanna, and Xianxin: four students from UC Berkeley currently taking <a href="make.berkeley.edu">Critical Making</a> (NM203/ME205).
      Critical making is a studio-based class in which students create "future computational experiences
      that critically explore social and culturally relevant technological themes". For our final project, the four of us wanted
      to focus our design around the issue of misogyny in the workplace.
    </p>
    <p class="ml6 bio" id="para2">
      We’re trying to make a statement on misogyny in the workplace. We’re creating a tie that can recognize when misogynistic
      words or phrases are spoken and flicks up and taps the wearer on the face to let them know that they need to check themselves.
      It’s a way to take action on this kind of sexism without having to worry about people facing consequences for standing up and calling someone out.
    </p>
    <p class="ml6 bio">
      Our website allows women to input misogynstic phrases that they gave heard in the workplace to help train our tie
      to better react in these situations. Users can also view a bulletin of all of the crowdsourced phrases our
      tie currently recognizes.
