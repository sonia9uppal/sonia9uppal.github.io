      We're Sonia, Lillian, Yoon, and Natasha: four members at the <a href="https://www.colab.fyi/makeathon/">IDEO CoLab Makeathon</a> in San Francisco.
      Today we were tasked with augmenting AI tools to help humans be better at their jobs while requiring human input and creativity.
      We decided to iterate in the space of education in K-6 elementary schools, specifically focused on diversity and inclusiond discussions
      in the classroom.</p>

          Thus Evergreen was formed. <i>Evergreen, our productive plant pet,</i> will listen to classroom conversations and bloom and
          grow based on <i>biased conversations that it overhears</i> triggered by our dialogFlow and firebase technical components.
          It will aggregate all of the data and present them on a Dashboard to help inform teachers of what subjects to cover
          and what biases their students are struggling with.
