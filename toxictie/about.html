      We're Sun, Sonia, Bryanna, and Sean: four students from <a href="berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> currently taking <a href="make.berkeley.edu">Critical Making</a> (NM203/ME205).
      Critical Making is a studio-based class in which students create "future computational experiences
      that critically explore social and culturally relevant technological themes". For our final project, the four of us wanted
      to focus our design around the issue of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/12/rebecca-traister-this-moment-isnt-just-about-sex.html">misogyny in the workplace</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-left bio smallpara">
      Our website allows women to input misogynstic phrases that they have heard in the workplace to help <a href="./form.html">train our tie</a>
      to better react in these situations. Users can also view a <a href="./bulletin">bulletin</a> of all of the crowdsourced phrases our
      tie currently recognizes.

        We’re trying to make a statement on misogyny in the workplace. We’re creating a tie that can <i>recognize when misogynistic
          words</i> or phrases are spoken and flicks up and <i>taps the wearer on the face</i> to let them know that they need to check themselves.
          It’s a <i>way to take action</i> on this kind of sexism <i>without having to worry</i> about people facing consequences for standing up and calling someone out.
